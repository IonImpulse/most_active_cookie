The only library used is `clap`, which helps to parse command line arguments.

## How to run
Alternatively, the program can be built first using `cargo build` and then running the provided binary.

Tests can be excecuted by running `cargo test`.

## Files
All code is currently in `src/main.rs`, with tests in `src/tests.rs`.
